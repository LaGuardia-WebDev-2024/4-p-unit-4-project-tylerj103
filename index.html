  <h1>Perfect Fall Day</h1>
  
  <h2>Start of the Day,   Apple Crisp </h2>
  <hr>
  <p>For the perfect fall day, we are going to start off the day with a tasty apple crisp recipe. For this recipe we are going to need: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Apples</li>
    <li>Whole rolled oats</li>
    <li>All-purpose flour</li>
    <li>Brown sugar</li>
    <li>Unsalted Butter</li>
    <li>Lemon Juice</li>
    <li>Vanilla, Cinanamon , and Nutmeg</li>
    <li>Sea Salt</li>
  </ul>
  <img src="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/apple-crisp-with-ice-cream-and-caramel.jpg" >
  <p>Start by prepping the apples. Peel them, core them, and chop them into roughly 3/4-inch pieces </p>
  <p>Place the apples in a large bowl and add the flour, brown sugar, lemon juice, vanilla extract, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt.

Toss until the flour, sugar, and spices evenly coat the apples.</p>
<p>Next, make the crumble topping. Stir together the remaining flour and sugar, the oats, cinnamon, and salt.</p>
<p>Add the cubed cold butter and toss to coat. Use a pastry cutter, two forks, or your hands to work it into the oat mixture until it becomes moist and crumbly</p>
<p>Sprinkle the crisp topping over the apples in the baking dish.</p>
<p>Finally, bake the crisp. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake at 375°F for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the apples are bubbling. Uncover and bake for another 15 minutes or so, until the topping is golden brown and lightly crisp.</p>
<p>Let cool for 10 minutes before eating!</p>

  <p>Going to apple picking and to a pumpkin patch is a great experience, getting to enjoy nature and bring home food with you. You could use these apples to make Apple Crisp, like I mentioned earlier or anything else apple related such as apple pie. Or you could just have them to eat. You could use the pumpkins for decorations, pumpkin carving, pumpkin painting, or even pumpkin pie! Here are 3 apple picking and 3 pumpkin patches near New York you could visit:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Outhouse Orchards, 139 Hardscrabble Rd, North Salem, NY  </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Outhouse Orchards in Westchester County is a family-friendly fall destination offering apple picking, hayrides, a corn maze, and more. Early visitors can pick apples like Gala and Jonamac, while later in the season features varieties such as Fuji and Baldwin, plus hard cider for everyone to enjoy.</p>
  <ul> 
    <li>Ochs Orchard, 4 Ochs Ln, Warwick, NY</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Ochs Orchard in Warwick offers scenic hilltop apple picking just minutes from Pennings, with picnic tables overlooking the countryside. Along with apples, visitors can enjoy a variety of fruits, a farm store with homemade ice cream, and fresh cider donuts in the fall.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Harvest Moon Farm & Orchard, 130 Hardscrabble Rd, North Salem, NY</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Harvest Moon Farm & Orchard, located across from Outhouse Orchards, offers a lively weekend atmosphere with apple picking, hayrides, live music, and family photo spots. Visitors can also enjoy hearty meals like the grilled gruyère sandwich with apple and hot pepper chutney, along with treats from the country store and food vendors.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Elwood Pumpkin Farm, NY</li>
  </ul>
  <p>An old-school style pumpkin farm out on Long Island with no entrance fees. Kids can pick pumpkins off the vine right where they grow, take a hayride, and navigate a modest corn maze. The picking begins Saturday, September 17. And there’s no admission fee. You simply pay based on the size of your pumpkin. Can’t get enough of this place? They become a “Christmas Tree Farm” when the season turns in November.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Harris Hill Farm , CT</li>
  </ul>
  <p>About two hours from NYC, but Connecticut’s Harris Hill Farm, located in the hills of Litchfield County is worth the trip. Pick pumpkins in a thoroughly pastoral setting (weathered red barn, farm animals and picturesque country scenery ), enjoy a hayride. They’ve got picnic tables on site for a fresh air picnic, and the view of the rolling hills in all their autumnal glory will make you feel like you’re on vacation.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Demarest Farms , NJ</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you are in a quick rush to pick out your pumpkin, this farm is close to Manhattan. Just about 30 minutes by car from Midtown Manhattan, this is right across the Hudson River. This location is great because you can do both pumpkin and apple picking. Admission includes a hayride, fresh apple cider, donuts and time with the farm animals.</p>

  <h1>Corn Maze</h1>
  <h2> A fall activity that tests your mind and pattern reconition </h2>

  <p>After the apple/pumpkin patch, its starting to get late.As we are losing daylight, it's best we head to the corn maze. The corn maze is very confusing, especially when it's dark. Corn mazes are a fun fall activity because they combine adventure, teamwork, and the beauty of the harvest season. Wandering through tall stalks of corn, trying to find your way out, feels like a real-life puzzle that’s perfect for families and friends to enjoy together. The crisp autumn air, colorful leaves, and festive atmosphere make it even more exciting. Whether you’re racing to the finish or just exploring at your own pace, a corn maze is a great way to celebrate fall and make lasting memories.</p>
