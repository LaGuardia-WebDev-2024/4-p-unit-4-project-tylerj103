  <h1>Perfect Fall Day</h1>
  
  <h2>Start of the Day,   Apple Crisp </h2>
  <hr>
  <p>For the perfect fall day, we are going to start off the day with a tasty apple crisp recipe. For this recipe we are going to need: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Apples</li>
    <li>Whole rolled oats</li>
    <li>All-purpose flour</li>
    <li>Brown sugar</li>
    <li>Unsalted Butter</li>
    <li>Lemon Juice</li>
    <li>Vanilla, Cinanamon , and Nutmeg</li>
    <li>Sea Salt</li>
  </ul>
  <img src="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/apple-crisp-with-ice-cream-and-caramel.jpg" >
  <p>Start by prepping the apples. Peel them, core them, and chop them into roughly 3/4-inch pieces </p>
  <p>Place the apples in a large bowl and add the flour, brown sugar, lemon juice, vanilla extract, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt.

Toss until the flour, sugar, and spices evenly coat the apples.</p>
<p>Next, make the crumble topping. Stir together the remaining flour and sugar, the oats, cinnamon, and salt.</p>
<p>Add the cubed cold butter and toss to coat. Use a pastry cutter, two forks, or your hands to work it into the oat mixture until it becomes moist and crumbly</p>
<p>Sprinkle the crisp topping over the apples in the baking dish.</p>
<p>Finally, bake the crisp. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake at 375°F for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the apples are bubbling. Uncover and bake for another 15 minutes or so, until the topping is golden brown and lightly crisp.</p>
<p>Let cool for 10 minutes before eating!</p>

  <p>Going to apple picking and to a pumpkin patch is a great experience, getting to enjoy nature and bring home food with you. You could use these apples to make Apple Crisp, like I mentioned earlier or anything else apple related such as apple pie. Or you could just have them to eat. You could use the pumpkins for decorations, pumpkin carving, pumpkin painting, or even pumpkin pie! Here are 3 apple picking and 3 pumpkin patches near New York you could visit:</p>
