    <li>Whole rolled oats</li>
    <li>All-purpose flour</li>
    <li>Brown sugar</li>
    <li>Unsalted Butter</li>

  <p>Start by prepping the apples. Peel them, core them, and chop them into roughly 3/4-inch pieces </p>
  <p>Place the apples in a large bowl and add the flour, brown sugar, lemon juice, vanilla extract, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt.

Toss until the flour, sugar, and spices evenly coat the apples.</p>
<p>Next, make the crumble topping. Stir together the remaining flour and sugar, the oats, cinnamon, and salt.</p>
<p>Add the cubed cold butter and toss to coat. Use a pastry cutter, two forks, or your hands to work it into the oat mixture until it becomes moist and crumbly</p>
<p>Sprinkle the crisp topping over the apples in the baking dish.</p>
<p>Finally, bake the crisp. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake at 375°F for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the apples are bubbling. Uncover and bake for another 15 minutes or so, until the topping is golden brown and lightly crisp.</p>
<p>Let cool for 10 minutes before eating!</p>
